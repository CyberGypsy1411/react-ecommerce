      <p>Dear Billo(Astha),</p>

      <p>
        I know… I messed up. Again. 🙈  
        And if I had a rupee for every time I annoyed you, I’d probably be rich enough to buy you all the Barbie dolls in the world. But instead of riches, here I am — rich in regret and sending you this digital love letter.
      </p>

      <p>
        You said you created drama, and blamed yourself — but love, let me say this clearly: it's okay. It really is. Emotions don’t come with a manual, and neither do relationships. We’re both learning, both flawed, both passionate. And that’s what makes this real.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m not some picture-perfect guy from a fairy tale — I make mistakes, get moody, say dumb things. But the one thing I never mess up is loving you. Completely. Truly. Every single day.
      </p>

      <p>
        You, with all your chaos and charm, are the most beautiful thing that’s ever happened to me. So please, stop being hard on yourself. If there's ever any drama — it’s ours to laugh at tomorrow, okay?
      </p>

      <p>
        So here’s me — in the most Barbie-pink way possible — saying sorry, not just with words but with heart.  
        Please forgive this not-so-perfect Ken who just wants to dance with his Barbie again — emotionally, literally, and even virtually 💃🏻🕺🏻
      </p>

      <p>Always yours,</p>
      <p>— Pankaj 💌</p>
